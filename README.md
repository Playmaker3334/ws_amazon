# ws_amazon
Project for the school about webscrapping

This scrapper was made as general as possible and is designed in such a way that it does not suffer convulsions if it does not detect a label since it works with different amazon products.      

I did the test with three different product links to test their generality, the for cycle is one of those links, it has nothing to do with the scrapper.
